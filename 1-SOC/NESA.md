  - Implement phishing simulations and other training exercises to enhance awareness.
  - Keep employees informed about the latest cybersecurity threats and best practices.

- **Compliance and Auditing**:
  - Regularly audit and review compliance with NESA IA standards.
  - Engage third-party auditors for independent assessments.
  - Maintain records of compliance activities and audit results.

#### 7. Supply Chain Security

- **Third-Party Risk Management**:
  - Assess the cybersecurity posture of third-party vendors and partners.
  - Implement contracts and agreements that include cybersecurity requirements.
  - Monitor third-party compliance with cybersecurity policies.

#### 8. Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

- **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)**:
  - Develop and maintain a BCP that includes cybersecurity considerations.
  - Conduct regular testing and updating of the BCP.
  - Ensure critical business functions can continue during and after a cyber incident.

- **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)**:
  - Develop and implement a DRP to recover from major incidents or disasters.
  - Regularly test and update the DRP.
  - Ensure backup and recovery procedures are in place and effective.

### Specific Technical Implementations

#### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

- **Integration**:
  - Integrate all relevant data sources into the SIEM, including firewalls, IDS/IPS, endpoint protection, and network devices.
  - Configure log collection and normalization to ensure consistent data input.

- **Use Cases and Correlation Rules**:
  - Develop and implement use cases and correlation rules to detect potential security incidents.
  - Regularly update and fine-tune these rules based on emerging threats and incidents.

#### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- **Identity Governance**:
  - Implement an identity governance framework to manage user identities and access rights.
  - Regularly review and update user access privileges.

- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - Implement strong authentication mechanisms, including MFA.
  - Use authorization protocols, such as OAuth and SAML, to control access to applications and services.

#### Threat Intelligence

- **Threat Intelligence Feeds**:
  - Subscribe to relevant threat intelligence feeds and integrate them into the SOC.
  - Use threat intelligence to enhance detection and response capabilities.

- **Analysis and Action**:
  - Analyze threat intelligence data to identify potential threats.
